        "description": "In a career that spanned decades, Captain “EJ” Smith saw the evolution of the shipping industry first-hand, as sailing ships were fully replaced by ever-growing steam ships. As a Captain for the illustrious White Star Line he earned a reputation as a steady hand, making the Atlantic crossing regularly, with some passengers only willing to cross so long as he was skipper. He maintained a high-level of confidence in the advanced ships, saying of White Star’s Adriatic: I cannot imagine any condition that would cause the Adriatic to founder. I cannot conceive of any fatal disaster happening to this ship. Modern shipbuilding has reduced that danger to a minimum. On Wednesday April 10th, 1912, White Star’s newest flagship Titanic left port at Southampton under Smith’s command. Despite a near-collision with another ship while leaving the harbor, Titanic’s maiden voyage proceeded for four days without incident. On Sunday, the Captain led the first class church services. Throughout the day, Captain Smith received several ice field warnings from the ship’s marconi wireless operators, but, as was standard practice at the time, maintained course and speed, relying on the lookouts to spot any potential dangers. That Sunday evening April 14th, Captain Smith was invited to dine with the Widener’s – a first class couple of great wealth and distinction – along with several other highly regarded passengers. He excused himself from the dinner party early, and checked in with the bridge crew. After leaving orders to awaken him if there was anything of concern, Smith retired to the Captain’s quarters, secure in the knowledge that, despite the ice warnings they’d received that day, Titanic was the most advanced piece of technology modern shipbuilding could produce.",
        "history": "Cecil Fitzpatrick overheard Captain Smith say they couldn't stay any longer, 'she's going'Harold Bride (and others?) saw Smith jump from the bridge as it went under. Fitzpatrick says he saw Andrews jump with him. He didn't really get interesting until after the iceberg to be honest. He didn't seem to be the best in a real emergency. ",

        "description": "Thomas Andrews Jr. was a naval architect and shipbuilder who took a leading role in the design and construction of Titanic. Andrews was born into the profession, as his uncle Lord Pirrie, was the principal owner of Belfast shipbuilders Harland & Wolff. Thomas began his career at Harland & Wolff at 16 as a premium apprentice, and continued to work his way up through the ranks, becoming thoroughly acquainted with every stage of shipbuilding before eventually being made Managing Director of the company in 1907. He was a hardworking, dedicated man, who was well-liked by his employees. He had a reputation for taking the safety and comfort of workers seriously, incorporating input from crew into designs. His wife recalled him referring to the shipyard workers as his “pals.” Andrews insisted on being present for the maiden voyage of all new ships, and during Olympic’s first run in 1911 the crew had gifted him with a walking stick they had chipped in to purchase themselves.For Titanic’s maiden voyage, Harland & Wolff sent a team known as the Guarantee Group. Lead by Andrews, this team of experts included representatives from a multitude of disciplines to ensure that everything onboard met Harland & Wolff’s standards of excellence. During the maiden voyage the guarantee group was employed throughout the ship to ensure passenger amenities were in working order, and to repair any incomplete or imperfect details. Despite his dedication to his work, those near him in the first days of the journey recall Andrews speaking often of home, his thoughts turning to his wife, and his young daughter back home in Ireland.",

        "description": "Jack Philips was the son of a draper who was afforded schooling at a young age. In 1902 he began work at the post office where he learned telegraphy. At nearly 20 he began training as a Marconi wireless operator. As a Marconi employee, Jack was posted aboard White Star ships as well as their primary competitor Cunard. He had served aboard Lusitania and Mauretania, the mammoth Cunard ships that had inspired White Star to commission the Olympic-class ships that included Titanic and her sisters. Marconi operators were a tight-knit bunch, and when Jack was hired as senior Marconi operator aboard Titanic, he and junior operator Harold Bride were quick to get along. They spent their days sending and fielding ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore messages. Some official ship business, but others personal messages from passengers. On April 13th, three days into the maiden voyage, Titanic’s wireless system broke down. Despite the Marconi company’s policy that operators were not to attempt repairs at sea, Jack used his off-shift to fix the machine instead of sleeping. That Sunday was spent by Jack and Harold frantically attempting to send the backlog of passenger messages from the day before to the shore station in Cape Race in Newfoundland. Besieged with the backlog of messages going out, the wireless operators were quick to hand incoming ice warnings off to the crew without sparing much time to worry about the contents.",

In 1893 he married Maude Bates, the two had four children. The family lived in Ripley until 1911, when Bell took lodging in Belfast with his wife and three-year old son so the other children could continue their schooling uninterrupted, though his oldest son Frank would soon join them in Belfast when he landed an apprenticeship with Harland and Wolff.Though he served as Chief Engineer for the maiden voyage, the plan was for him to hand these duties off to another engineer and return to Belfast to oversee the completion of the final Olympic-class sister: Britannic. It was a routine he had completed numerous times before: after overseeing construction on a ship, Bell would then act as the ship’s first Chief Engineer, taking it on its first few voyages before returning to Belfast to oversee White Star’s next project. He had done the same with oldest sister Olympic: playing a major role in her construction and taking her to sea for her maiden voyage, before handing Chief Engineering duties off to Robert Flemming so that Bell could return to Belfast to complete work on Titanic.",

Four years later, Mrs. Wallace lost her mother shortly before the birth of her second child. Over the next eight years Catherine and James raised four children together, and Catherine was a homemaker. In 1911 tragedy struck the family again, and Catherine lost her husband and her father within one year of each other. As a Southampton native in need of work to support her four children it was natural for Mrs. Wallis to look to the liners constantly coming and going from port for a job. She found employment with White Star Line as an assistant matron with victualling crews. Her oldest child Melita was only twelve when her mother began working at sea, so it is unclear who would look after her own children while Mrs. Wallis was away at her new post as a matron looking after female passengers and families aboard the Titanic.",

He worked aboard ships throughout his teen years and into his 20s on voyages which took him to South America, Australia, India and West Africa. At 24 he decided on a whim to join the gold rush and spent 1898 trekking through the Canadian wilderness in search of claims. Failing to find enough gold to make a living, he tried driving cattle, but soon determined he would have better luck returning to Britain and sailing. Lightoller was made first officer of White Star Line’s newest ship Titanic, and in March of 1912  boarded for her sea trials along with other senior officers William Murdoch and David Blair. He wrote of the ship’s scale: “It is difficult to convey any idea of the size of a ship like the Titanic, when you could actually walk miles along decks and passages, covering different ground all the time.” After Titanic’s sea trials, White Star higher ups decided to bring Olympic’s chief officer Henry Wilde on to serve on Titanic’s maiden voyage, dropping Murdoch and Lightoller both down in rank, and bumping Blair, who was considered too senior to serve as third officer, off the ship entirely. Disappointed, Blair wrote to his sister: 'This is a magnificent ship, I feel very disappointed I am not to make her first voyage.'' ",

Keeping the boilers lit on steam engines was the responsibility of teams of men called stokers (firemen), and trimmers. The stokers, or firemen, were assigned three furnaces at a time, spending their four hour shifts shoveling coal. Trimmers moved coal throughout the ship, not only transporting it to the firemen for use in the boiler, but maneuvering the stored coal throughout the ship to maintain weight distribution. Each section was under the supervision of leading firemen, or Stoker Foremen The boiler crew worked in three shifts, of four hour watches, with eight hours between shifts to recover from the blistering temperatures and backbreaking work in the boilers. At 11:40 PM on Sunday the 14th of April Barrett was working in boiler room 6, nearing the end of his second 8-12 shift of the day, and he and the rest of his crew were likely looking forward to their hard-earned shift break and escaping the stiflingly hot boiler rooms.",
