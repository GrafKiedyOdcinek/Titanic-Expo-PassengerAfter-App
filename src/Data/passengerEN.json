        "description": "In a career that spanned decades, Captain “EJ” Smith saw the evolution of the shipping industry first-hand, as sailing ships were fully replaced by ever-growing steam ships. As a Captain for the illustrious White Star Line he earned a reputation as a steady hand, making the Atlantic crossing regularly, with some passengers only willing to cross so long as he was skipper. He maintained a high-level of confidence in the advanced ships, saying of White Star’s Adriatic: I cannot imagine any condition that would cause the Adriatic to founder. I cannot conceive of any fatal disaster happening to this ship. Modern shipbuilding has reduced that danger to a minimum. On Wednesday April 10th, 1912, White Star’s newest flagship Titanic left port at Southampton under Smith’s command. Despite a near-collision with another ship while leaving the harbor, Titanic’s maiden voyage proceeded for four days without incident. On Sunday, the Captain led the first class church services. Throughout the day, Captain Smith received several ice field warnings from the ship’s marconi wireless operators, but, as was standard practice at the time, maintained course and speed, relying on the lookouts to spot any potential dangers. That Sunday evening April 14th, Captain Smith was invited to dine with the Widener’s – a first class couple of great wealth and distinction – along with several other highly regarded passengers. He excused himself from the dinner party early, and checked in with the bridge crew. After leaving orders to awaken him if there was anything of concern, Smith retired to the Captain’s quarters, secure in the knowledge that, despite the ice warnings they’d received that day, Titanic was the most advanced piece of technology modern shipbuilding could produce.",
        "history": "Cecil Fitzpatrick overheard Captain Smith say they couldn't stay any longer, 'she's going'Harold Bride (and others?) saw Smith jump from the bridge as it went under. Fitzpatrick says he saw Andrews jump with him. He didn't really get interesting until after the iceberg to be honest. He didn't seem to be the best in a real emergency. ",

        "description": "Thomas Andrews Jr. was a naval architect and shipbuilder who took a leading role in the design and construction of Titanic. Andrews was born into the profession, as his uncle Lord Pirrie, was the principal owner of Belfast shipbuilders Harland & Wolff. Thomas began his career at Harland & Wolff at 16 as a premium apprentice, and continued to work his way up through the ranks, becoming thoroughly acquainted with every stage of shipbuilding before eventually being made Managing Director of the company in 1907. He was a hardworking, dedicated man, who was well-liked by his employees. He had a reputation for taking the safety and comfort of workers seriously, incorporating input from crew into designs. His wife recalled him referring to the shipyard workers as his “pals.” Andrews insisted on being present for the maiden voyage of all new ships, and during Olympic’s first run in 1911 the crew had gifted him with a walking stick they had chipped in to purchase themselves.For Titanic’s maiden voyage, Harland & Wolff sent a team known as the Guarantee Group. Lead by Andrews, this team of experts included representatives from a multitude of disciplines to ensure that everything onboard met Harland & Wolff’s standards of excellence. During the maiden voyage the guarantee group was employed throughout the ship to ensure passenger amenities were in working order, and to repair any incomplete or imperfect details. Despite his dedication to his work, those near him in the first days of the journey recall Andrews speaking often of home, his thoughts turning to his wife, and his young daughter back home in Ireland.",

At nearly 20 he began training as a Marconi wireless operator. As a Marconi employee, Jack was posted aboard White Star ships as well as their primary competitor Cunard. He had served aboard Lusitania and Mauretania, the mammoth Cunard ships that had inspired White Star to commission the Olympic-class ships that included Titanic and her sisters. Marconi operators were a tight-knit bunch, and when Jack was hired as senior Marconi operator aboard Titanic, he and junior operator Harold Bride were quick to get along. They spent their days sending and fielding ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore messages. Some official ship business, but others personal messages from passengers. On April 13th, three days into the maiden voyage, Titanic’s wireless system broke down. Despite the Marconi company’s policy that operators were not to attempt repairs at sea, Jack used his off-shift to fix the machine instead of sleeping. That Sunday was spent by Jack and Harold frantically attempting to send the backlog of passenger messages from the day before to the shore station in Cape Race in Newfoundland. Besieged with the backlog of messages going out, the wireless operators were quick to hand incoming ice warnings off to the crew without sparing much time to worry about the contents.",

It was a routine he had completed numerous times before: after overseeing construction on a ship, Bell would then act as the ship’s first Chief Engineer, taking it on its first few voyages before returning to Belfast to oversee White Star’s next project.

Over the next eight years Catherine and James raised four children together, and Catherine was a homemaker. In 1911 tragedy struck the family again, and Catherine lost her husband and her father within one year of each other. As a Southampton native in need of work to support her four children it was natural for Mrs. Wallis to look to the liners constantly coming and going from port for a job. She found employment with White Star Line as an assistant matron with victualling crews. Her oldest child Melita was only twelve when her mother began working at sea, so it is unclear who would look after her own children while Mrs. Wallis was away at her new post as a matron looking after female passengers and families aboard the Titanic.",

He worked aboard ships throughout his teen years and into his 20s on voyages which took him to South America, Australia, India and West Africa. At 24 he decided on a whim to join the gold rush and spent 1898 trekking through the Canadian wilderness in search of claims. Failing to find enough gold to make a living, he tried driving cattle, but soon determined he would have better luck returning to Britain and sailing. Lightoller was made first officer of White Star Line’s newest ship Titanic, and in March of 1912  boarded for her sea trials along with other senior officers William Murdoch and David Blair. He wrote of the ship’s scale: “It is difficult to convey any idea of the size of a ship like the Titanic, when you could actually walk miles along decks and passages, covering different ground all the time.” After Titanic’s sea trials, White Star higher ups decided to bring Olympic’s chief officer Henry Wilde on to serve on Titanic’s maiden voyage, dropping Murdoch and Lightoller both down in rank, and bumping Blair, who was considered too senior to serve as third officer, off the ship entirely. Disappointed, Blair wrote to his sister: 'This is a magnificent ship, I feel very disappointed I am not to make her first voyage.'' ",

Keeping the boilers lit on steam engines was the responsibility of teams of men called stokers (firemen), and trimmers.

Trimmers moved coal throughout the ship, not only transporting it to the firemen for use in the boiler, but maneuvering the stored coal throughout the ship to maintain weight distribution. Each section was under the supervision of leading firemen, or Stoker Foremen The boiler crew worked in three shifts, of four hour watches, with eight hours between shifts to recover from the blistering temperatures and backbreaking work in the boilers. At 11:40 PM on Sunday the 14th of April Barrett was working in boiler room 6, nearing the end of his second 8-12 shift of the day, and he and the rest of his crew were likely looking forward to their hard-earned shift break and escaping the stiflingly hot boiler rooms.",

He had been a manager with White Star when his father’s Oceanic class ships dominated the passenger trade in the 1870s, and had been a part of the ensuing oceanliner arms race that resulted in the building of some of the largest vessels known to mankind. In the wake of the debuts of the Cunard behemoths Mauretania and Lusitania, Ismay dined with Lord Pirrie, head of Harland & Wolff shipbuilders. The two determined White Star’s next steps would be, of course, to go bigger, and shortly thereafter Harland & Wolff began design work on the new Olympic class of ships.The Olympic liners would be technological marvels of speed and luxury. Equipped with the cutting edge Marconi wireless apparatus, and the revolutionary system of watertight bulkheads, the ships would be as close to unsinkable as it was possible to be.During the design process, chief designer Alexander Carlisle was in favor of adding more lifeboats to the ship. The Board of Trade regulations were based on ship weight, not number of passengers, written at a time when a ship the weight of Titanic could scarcely be conceived of. However, with the combination of the wireless system and the slow-filling bulkheads, designers believed in case of emergency there would be ample time for rescue ships to arrive and carry passengers to safety. In such an emergency, lifeboats would act only as ferries between vessels, and as such were thought not to be essential life-saving equipment for Titanic’s maiden voyage.",

        "description": "John Jacob Astor IV was a member of the famed Astor family. American royalty at the turn of the century, Astor was an intriguing figure of public interest with a major impact on New York. The city’s famous Waldorph and Astoria hotels were both built as part of a public rivalry Astor had with his cousin. Astor served as a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish American War, personally financing a volunteer artillery unit known as the Astor Battery, and before the conflict ended received a war promotion to Colonel. Despite being one of the richest men in America, his public stock began to take a downfall in 1909 when he divorced his wife – the mother of his two children – amid rumors of adultery with a young woman named Madelaine Force, only 18 at the time. Shortly thereafter, he further damaged his image in the eyes of the upper echelons of American society by marrying the young woman. Astor’s son Vincent served as the best man at the wedding, though he was less than two years older than the bride.Hoping to escape public scrutiny, Astor and his young bride took an extended honeymoon, spending several weeks in Europe and Egypt. When the time came to return to New York it seemed the obvious choice to book passage aboard the newest and most luxurious ship on the ocean: the Titanic.",

Given her family's resources, Alice was able to pursue a career few woman in her time would even consider, and attended one of the first schools in the world founded for the training of women as doctors, receiving her MD in 1884.Dr. Farnham had a special interest in what would later come to be known as mental health, and in 1886 she was one of the resident physicians of the Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane. Dr. Farnham also focused on women's issues, and did research as an assistant at Willard State Hospital that was cited by the New York State Medical Association in 1891 in debunking so-called “uterine psychology,” an antiquated idea of women’s health that attempted to correlate physical gynecological disorders with insanity.In 1892, Dr. Farnham met and married another physician, Dr. John Augustine Leader. They both practiced medicine until his unexpected death eight years later. Despite the tragic loss of her husband, Dr. Farnham Leader continued to travel throughout her life, making multiple trips to Europe. In spring of 1912 she was preparing to return home from a trip to Europe with her companion Margaret Swift, and their friends Frederick and Marion Kenyon. Mrs. Kenyon spoke of her husband reporting the news that they would be traveling home aboard Titanic: “Well, I have a wonderful surprise for you!  We are going on the unsinkable Titanic, the most wonderful ship that has ever been born!”",

Her brother Daniel became a miner, and Maggie took work sewing. She met J.J. Brown while living in Colorado, and though she had been hoping to marry a rich miner, she fell in love with a poor one and married him anyway. Some years after their marriage, and the birth of their children, J.J. was instrumental in helping his company strike gold in a mine already deplete of silver. Maggie Brown had her rich miner. With wealth came access to a whole new social strata, and Maggie became involved with a variety of interests, from foreign languages to womens’ suffrage.Throughout the years, strain on their marriage and growing apart meant that Maggie and J.J. separated, though there was no bad blood between them. Maggie continued to storm the social world, and by 1912 she was traveling in Paris as part of the coterie of one of America’s richest men, and visiting her daughter who was studying at the prestigious Sorbonne. A young grandmother at forty-five, Maggie was extremely attentive, and when she learned that her eldest grandchild back home was ill, she was quick to curtail her trip and rush her return to Colorado. Luckily, White Star’s newest ship was a highly prized ticket, as well as being virtually unsinkable, so Mrs. Brown didn’t even need to pause her social life for the return trip aboard Titanic.",

At 18 years old, Daniel married his Scottish-born sweetheart Mary Graham Carmichael Farquharson. Mary’s mother and aunt were the prominent designers Farquharson & Wheelock – known for their elegant and fashionable ladies dresses. (Farquharson & Wheelock dresses were in such demand that in 1910 two were stolen from the daughter of former president Teddy Roosevelt.) By 1912 the designers had achieved a coveted place address on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue.  Daniel and Mary were wed in a secret Manhattan ceremony in January 1912. In March of that same year, they held a public ceremony. Mary wore a Farquharson & Wheelock wedding dress, and the re-staged wedding was filmed in front of Daniel’s fathers cameras, creating some of the first known wedding footage. For their honeymoon the young newlyweds traveled to Europe aboard Cunard’s speedy and luxurious Mauritania. Their return trip home from England promised to be even more luxurious, as they were booked in the first class of the world’s largest steamer: Titanic.",

Loraine’s mother was an American named Bess Waldo Daniels from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The two were married in 1908, and welcomed Loraine a year later. Loraine’s brother Trevor was born on May 7, 1911. In 1912 Hudson took his family with him to England as part of a business trip. The Allisons were devout Methodists, and part of their trip included a visit to Epworth, so that baby Trevor could be baptized in a place of historical importance to the Methodists. Another important part of their trip to England was to procure furniture and staff for the new house they had built in Quebec, all of which would be transported back on the luxurious new liner: Titanic. The Allisons had three first class cabins on the Upper Deck. Two of the new servants traveled with them to look after the children, while the other two traveled in second class. On the evening of April 14th, little Loraine joined her mother in the first class dining room to admire the decor before her parents sat down to dinner. ",

He was from an affluent family, favored during the Porfiriato – a period in Mexico’s political history when Porfirio Díaz was in power, and championing European standards of masculinity, restraint, and civility. Uruchurtu moved south to study law in Mexico City, and found success as a lawyer and politician. He had married a fellow student from an aristocratic family, and the two had seven children, as Uruchurtu’s career flourished. Uruchurtu became close with Ramón Corral, one of Díaz’s inner circle, who would one day serve as vice president.In 1911, Díaz and his political elites were forced to resign and exiled to France, including Uruchurtu’s friend and mentor Corral. The following year, Uruchurtu visited Corral in Paris, and was set to return via S.S. France, destined for Vera Cruz. During his stay in Paris, he was approached by fellow politician Guillermo Obregón, who was also returning to Mexico. Obregón had already purchased his tickets, but now had need of a more direct route back to Mexico City. Obergón requested that Uruchurtu exchange tickets with him, and in exchange for taking the less direct route, he would get the chance of a lifetime to travel in the height of British luxury in first class on the maiden voyage of the celebrated new steamer Titanic.",

He was a wealthy businessman who owned a farm in Argentina, and had been living in Buenos Aires before traveling to Germany to visit his nephew, who had a position at the Uruguayan Consulate in Berlin. Before departing Queenstown for the Atlantic crossing, Artagaveytia wrote to his brother Adolfo, describing the ship, though he found it difficult to capture. He wrote about the sheer size of the ship, the number of staff, and the amenities of his room and the size of the first class dining room. He spoke of meeting a Mexican politician at dinner the night prior – likely Manuel Ramirez Uruchurtu. Artagaveytia described boarding Titanic with his eyes closed, for although the ship’s facilities were magnificent, he had a traumatic history with ships. 31 years prior, in 1871, Artagaveytia had been a passenger aboard the America – a wooden paddle steamship destined for Montevideo. However, the ship caught fire, and Artagaveytia was one of only 64 survivors who escaped the flames of the sinking ship, leaving him with nightmares of the flames when traveling, even three decades later. He wrote to his cousin earlier in 1912. “...I have even gotten to the point where I find myself standing in the deck with my lifebelt on…”",

Candee was a freelance writer, interior decorator, author, and suffragette who had penned articles for publications like the Lady’s Home Journal, Harper’s Bazaar, and Scribner’s Monthly as well as writing several books. In the late 1800s Candee and the children relocated to the Oklahoma Territory in hopes of obtaining a divorce, which the laws of the time would allow. While there, she gained prominence writing about her life, contributing to the Boomer Movement of the time. The movement encouraged non-native settler migration to the Oklahoma Territory: land which had been previously set aside as part of Indian Territory after the forceful relocation of many Native American tribes earlier in the 19th century. Candee’s pro-Oklahoma publications included her only book of fiction: a novel called “An Oklahoma Romance”.Candee continued to gain prominence with her books about subjects like women’s ability to contribute to the workforce (How Women May Earn A Living, 1900,) and interior decoration (Decorative Styles and Periods, 1906). In 1912 Candee had been researching a book in Europe when she received word her son had been badly injured in an accident. She immediately planned her return, booking passage aboard the Titanic, where she could distract herself from worry among the finery of the social class on the most luxurious liner afloat.",
